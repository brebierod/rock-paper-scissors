# rock-paper-scissors
Programming exercise to play rock paper scissors

This game is primary javascript code, with the game being played through prompts and alerts. The game can be played through once up and then you need to refresh to play again. I use "1" "2" and "3" in place of Rock, Paper, and Scissors in order to cut down on possible errors.
